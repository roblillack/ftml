# This is an example FTML document

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate the following use-cases:

- Describe the features supported by FTML.

- Showcase the FTML standard formatting enforced by `fmtftml`.

## Supported features

### Inline styles

The following inline styles are supported in FTML:

- **Bold** text.

- _Italic_ text.

- <mark>Highlighted</mark> text.

- <u>Underlined</u> text.

- ~~Striked~~ text.

- Text formatted as `code`.

### Text paragraphs

This is a rather long paragraph to show the text-wrapping supported by the Markdown exporter.

### Quoted paragraphs

TBD

### Bullet points

TBD

**Example:**

- This is a bullet point.

- This is another bullet point.

  Contrasting to the first bullet point, this one contains multiple paragraps, with this one being the second one.

- > This bulletpoint contains a quote.

### Paragraph nesting

FTML supports nesting of paragraphs, so this is entirely possible:

> Please see, how the following list is part of a quote and contains nested paragraphs.
>
> - This is a paragraph inside of a quoted paragraph
>
> - This bullet points contains another quote:
>
>   > You can never have enough nesting of paragraphs.
